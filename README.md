# RISC-V

The Verilog code was originally written for my Digital Design with Programmable Logic (EE 4301) course at the University of Minnesota.

iverilog (github.com/steveicarus/iverilog) is used for compiling/running the verilog.

Compiling: `make` (or `make riscv`)

Run `make clean` to remove `riscv`
